        While cockapoos tend to be healthy and hardy dogs, they can be prone to the same genetic predispositions to health conditions that affect either of their parent breeds
        This can include cataracts, patellar luxation, hip dysplasia, allergies and liver disease. When considering a cockapoo puppy. 

        <br>

        It's important to do your research and seek a reputable breeder who is happy to answer any questions you have about the parents and their health status.
        Cockapoos do well in apartments, although maxi cockapoos may be less well-suited for small living spaces than their smaller counterparts. 
        They have a moderate amount of energy and can be quite bouncy, but they're also happy to curl up in a lap or next to you on the sofa. 
        They generally require about 15 minutes of exercise a day, which can be achieved by playing in the backyard or with a quick walk around the block.

        <br>

        Although their coats don't require regular cutting like a poodle's, they do need to be brushed regularly. 
        Their floppy ears are prone to infections and should be cleaned and inspected on a weekly basis. 
        Signs of an ear infection include an unpleasant odor coming from the ear, redness or swelling, itching, and constant head shaking.
