# Cockapoo-Club

This website provides a local 1-stop-shop for all kinds of information about Cockapoos, one of Ireland's most popular dogs. 
The site targets people who have or are thinking about getting a cockapoo. 

For people who will become cockapoo owners for the first time the 'New Cockaparents' section provides a set of FAQs and links to other relevant evidence-based websites that will help new owners plan and adjust to their new member of the family.

For people who want to learn more about maintaining their pet's wellbeing, there is the section called 'Keep your Poo healthy'. This section consists of relevant information and and links to other relevant evidence-based websites to help owners take care of the health needs of their pet.

The 'Furry Fun' section is for users to peruse and upload images of their pet. This section provides a gallery of shared images.

As a starting point I began with the html and css structure used in Code Institute's Love Running Project. I did this mainly because I thought the hero image with zoom was a great way to engage a new user. I also wanted to have a feature that allwoed users to 'join' a club, so the Love Running project provided a good blueprint for adapting to Cockapoo Club. 

I gave Cockapoo Club a fictional clubhouse and training space with an actual geolocated address on Google Maps. I researched how do this online and used https://www.embedgooglemap.net/.
